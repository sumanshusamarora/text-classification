# Text Classification
____________________________________________________________________________________________
This repo is a base repo for text classification. There are many steps involved in a full text classification project including -
1) Data Cleaning
2) Data splitting
3) Tf-Idf vectorisation
4) Model selection
5) Parameters selection
6) Model Saving
7) Prediction

This repo takes care of all the above steps in just 8-10 lines of code to produce a base model which in most cased would give you over 70% accuracy. With certain tweaks to paramaters and adding domain specific cleaning steps users can expect the accuracy to increase.

# What can i expect in future versions?

While this is very basic but effective model as of now, i look to add embeddings and deep learning options in future versions.
